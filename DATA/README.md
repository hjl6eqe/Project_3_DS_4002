The csv file from Kaggle is 50 MB and cannot be included in git hub, but it can be accessed from the following link:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction

We recommend reading the file as a csv into RStudio using the read.csv() function after downloading it onto your computer.
